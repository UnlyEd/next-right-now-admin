# Getting started

## Showcases - Live demo

https://nrn-admin.unly.now.sh/

> **Tip**: You can get metadata at [/api/status](https://nrn-admin.unly.now.sh/api/status)
>
> **Tip**: All `/api/*` are serverless functions, running under AWS Lambda

## Super quick local installation (for local-only testing purpose, without Zeit account)

> This assumes you've **cloned** the project on your own computer.
>
> Follow this guide **if you just want to try it out** on your local machine
>
> **Tip**: Using now@17+ is required for CI to work properly, but you don't care about that if you just want to get started quickly.

- Duplicate the [`.env.build.example`](./.env.build.example) and rename it `.env.build` _(this file is only used on your local computer)_
- `nvm use` - (Optional) Selects the right node.js version based on our [`.nvmrc`](./.nvmrc) file
- `yarn add -D now@16.7.3`, now@17+ requires to be authenticated to Zeit in order to launch the project, even if only working locally, so you can use now@16 instead to avoid creating a Zeit account
- `yarn` - Installs all deps from [`package.json`](./package.json)
- (Optional) Customise `GRAPHQL_API_ENDPOINT` and `GRAPHQL_API_KEY` to use your own. You can also use the default ones (readonly)
- (Optional) Customise `AMPLITUDE_API_KEY` and `SENTRY_DSN` to use your own. You can also leave them empty
- `yarn start` - Starts the app on [http://localhost:8888/](http://localhost:8888/)
- That's it! The project now runs on your local computer
    - **Tip**: It'll still be using the demo GraphCMS/GraphQL endpoint if you haven't changed `GRAPHQL_API_ENDPOINT`
    - **Tip**: The default GraphCMS token is readonly, mutations (add, update, delete operations) will fail

> **Tip**: You can start the project in **debug mode** (built-in for WebStorm only) [by running the WebStorm "Debug" configuration in debug mode](https://youtu.be/3vbkiRAT4e8)
>
> **Tip**: If there are tools that you don't need/like, read our [guide about how to remove them](README_HOW_TO_REMOVE.md).

## Online installation (on Zeit)

If you want to deploy your local project online, run `yarn deploy:production`.

You will likely need to run `now` first, to authenticate and such. Also, you need to define the secrets (see [Zeit advanced configuration guide](#zeit-advanced-configuration-guide)).

### Zeit advanced configuration guide

See https://github.com/UnlyEd/next-right-now/blob/master/README_HOW_TO_USE.md#online-installation-on-zeit

Steps are similar. This NRN-Admin doesn't use Locize though, so you can skip it.

# Understanding `Environments` and `Stages`

> The application relies on environment variables to function correctly.
> Those variables are provided differently depending on the environment.

When working on the `development` environment (localhost), the variables from [`.env.build`](.env.build) are used by [the webpack configuration](./next.config.js)

When deploying an instance to the Zeit's platform, the variables used are the one that belong to that instance, such as:
- `yarn deploy`: This script will deploy in staging (AKA "Preview" on Zeit) using the [`now.staging.json`](now.staging.json) file.
- `yarn deploy:production`: This script will deploy on production using the [`now.production.json`](now.production.json) file.

> In those files, it's the `build.env` part that is used at build time (build is done on Zeit), which basically replaces all references of every environment variable by the actual value (string replace).

## What is an `environment`?

> An environment is "where" the application is running.
> It can be either "development" (localhost) or "production" (on Zeit's servers).
>
> **The `environment` is defined by the `NODE_ENV` environment variable.**
>
> **N.B**: It is not possible to any other value, [as enforced by Next](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/blob/master/errors/env-key-not-allowed.md)

When working on your local computer, you automatically use `NODE_ENV=developement`.

The environment affects how the application **is bundled**, it is used at **build time**. (webpack, hot-reloading, etc.)

> i.e: In `development` environment, you have access to PropTypes warnings, but you won't in `production`.

## What is a `stage`?

> A stage is "how" the application is running.
> It can be either "development" (localhost), "staging" or "production" (on Zeit's servers) - _You can add more if you need_
>
> **The `stage` is defined by the `APP_STAGE` environment variable.**
>
> **N.B**: You can use any stage name you like, there is no restriction.

- When working on your local computer, you automatically use `APP_STAGE=developement`.
- When creating a Zeit preview deployment (i.e: when pushing a commit/branch (CD), when using `yarn deploy`, etc.), you automatically use `APP_STAGE=staging`.
- When creating a Zeit production deployment (i.e: when using `yarn deploy:production`, when merging a PR to `master`, etc.), you automatically use `APP_STAGE=production`.

The stage changes the behaviour of the application, because we sometimes need the application to behave differently depending on the stage.

> i.e: In `production` stage, the Locize configuration uses the `production` version.
> When using another stage, it uses the `latest` version.

> i.e: We don't want to enable the same level of debugging in production environment.
> For instance, Locize is configured to be in `debug` mode only in non-production stages.

# [Amplitude](https://amplitude.com/) (Analytics)

> Amplitude is used to collect usage metrics (analytics) of the application.

Amplitude **is used only on the frontend part of the application**. It is composed of two parts:
- [`@amplitude/react-amplitude`](https://github.com/amplitude/react-amplitude): React components easy to use, see their [blog post](https://amplitude.engineering/introducing-react-amplitude-d7b5258bc708).
- [`amplitude-js`](https://github.com/amplitude/Amplitude-JavaScript): The JS SDK, only compatible from the browser. (They're working on making it [compatible with SSR](https://github.com/amplitude/Amplitude-JavaScript/issues/164))

See the [documentation example at react-amplitude](https://github.com/amplitude/react-amplitude#example-instrumenting-tic-tac-toe-from-facebooks-intro-to-react-tutorial) to understand how it's meant to be used.
We only use react-amplitude to manipulate events.

> **Known limitation**: Amplitude doesn't provide any backend-compatible API. See https://github.com/amplitude/Amplitude-JavaScript/issues/164

## Chrome developer debug tool

> The amplitude team has released a Chrome plugin to see the events from the browser.
>
> It is a **must-have** when working with Amplitude. It's very simple to use and quite helpful.

# Continuous Integration & Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)

## Overview

> Every time a commit is pushed to the repository, or a branch is merged, automated actions are triggered.
>
> Those actions are managed through Github Actions

## Workflow of our Zeit <> Github Actions integration

Here is how the multiple steps are ordered:

1. [Event] A commit is pushed, a branch is merged (or on any change made on the remote repository)
1. [Trigger] Our [Github Actions](./.github/workflows) are triggered
    - Either the staging scripts is executed, or the production script, depending on which branch is impacted (see [Github Actions <> Zeit integrations](./.github/workflows/README.md))
    - No matter what script (production vs staging) gets executed, those actions are always triggered:
        1. A new Zeit deployment is triggered, which runs our tests first (`yarn test:once`) (Failing tests will stop the deployment)
        1. Then, the deployment is deployed, and automatically linked to a custom domain which depends on the git branch name (xxx.now.sh)
        1. Then, our 2E2 tests are triggered using Cypress
            - If they fail, artifacts (screenshots, videos) recorded by Cypress are uploaded to Github to help further debug (See [example](https://github.com/UnlyEd/next-right-now-admin/runs/487000885))

## In-depth project's dependencies

See [README_DEPENDENCIES](./README_DEPENDENCIES.md)


---

# Testing

## CI tests Workflow

Zeit will automatically run the tests before deploying, as configured in the `yarn build` command.

> If any test fail, the deployment will be aborted. This ensures that any code that doesn't pass the tests never get deployed online.

Once a deployment has been deployed on Zeit, **Github Actions** will run our **E2E tests**, to make sure that the app behaves as expected.
This can also be considered as an integration tests suite.

## Running tests manually (locally)
You can run interactive tests using Jest with `yarn test` script.

## Running E2E tests manually (locally)
You can run interactive E2E tests using Cypress with `yarn e2e:open` script.

You can also run them non-interactively using `yarn e2e:run` script.

> You may need to run `yarn e2e:install` script first

# Project folders structure

> Overview of the project folder and files structure

- `cypress`: Folder used by Cypress (E2E), see ["Getting started"](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/getting-started/installing-cypress.html#npm-install)
- `public`: Static files, see ["Static file serving](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/static-file-serving)
- `src`: Source code of the app
    - `Components`: React components
        - `__snapshots__`: Folder used by Jest when using [Snapshot testing](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/snapshot-testing)
